/*
======= Love vs friendship (7 kyu) =======
Ifã€€a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26

Then l + o + v + e = 54

and f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108

So friendship is twice as strong as love :-)

Your task is to write a function which calculates the value of a word based off 
the sum of the alphabet positions of its characters.

The input will always be made of only lowercase letters and will never be empty.

1) Parameter - A word given as a string
2) Return -  The value of a word, as a number, based off the sum of the alphabet
             positions of its characters.
3) Examples - see tests
4) Pseudocode - see comments

*/

function wordsToMarks(string) {
  // Sum the alphabet position value of each letter in string
  return string
    .split("")
    .reduce((acc, val) => acc + (val.charCodeAt() - 96), 0);
}

// Tests
console.log(wordsToMarks("attitude"), 100);
console.log(wordsToMarks("friends"), 75);
console.log(wordsToMarks("family"), 66);
console.log(wordsToMarks("selfness"), 99);
console.log(wordsToMarks("knowledge"), 96);
